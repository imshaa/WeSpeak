# 🗣 WeSpeak - Robotic Voice Generator

WeSpeak is a **text-to-speech (TTS) application** powered by Python and `pyttsx3`. It allows users to input text, which is then converted into speech using a robotic voice. This project is ideal for accessibility applications, voice assistance, and interactive speech programs.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔊 Converts text input into speech
- 🏃 Works **offline** without an internet connection
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight
- 🛠 Adjustable speech rate
- 🛑 Allows users to exit by typing **'stop'**

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- `pyttsx3` (Offline text-to-speech engine)

## 📥 Installation
### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/imshaa/WeSpeak.git
cd WeSpeak
```

### 2️⃣ Install required dependencies
```sh
pip install pyttsx3
```

## 🎤 How It Works
1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter any text you want to convert to speech.
3. Type **'stop'** to exit.

## 📜 Usage
```sh
python wespeak.py
```
Then enter a text input when prompted, and the robotic voice will read it aloud.

## 📌 Example Output
```sh
Enter Your Text: Hello, how are you?
🔊 (Speaks: "Hello, how are you?")
Enter Your Text: stop
🔊 (Speaks: "Goodbye. Thanks for your time.")
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- ✅ Add support for multiple voices
- ✅ Implement GUI version using Tkinter
